# AIR QUALITY CLASSIFICATION

Air pollution is one of the issues in society. Air pollution affects human health and the environment. In Indonesia, the **Air Pollution Standard Index (ISPU)** is measured from the levels of particulate matter 10 (PM10), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O3), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Therefore, the **CNN algorithm** is used to classify the air quality index based on the ISPU standard.
